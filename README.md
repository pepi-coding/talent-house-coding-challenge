Here's a polished `README.md` for your project, using markdown formatting, emojis for clarity, and clear instructions for running the setup:

# 🧩 Multi-API Dockerized Project

This project contains **two APIs** running in isolated containers via Docker Compose:

- ⚙️ **Go API** – built with Golang 1.18
- 🌐 **Node.js API** – built with Node.js 16

Each service runs independently but shares a common Docker network for communication. Perfect for local development, testing, or building microservices!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

---

## 🔧 Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
````

2. **Start the services** using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:

   - Build the Go API from the `go-api` folder
   - Build the Node API from the `node-api` folder
   - Run both containers on the same virtual network

3. **Access the APIs**:

   - Go API: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Node API: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

---

## 🛑 Stopping the Services

To stop the services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, but not delete the images.

---

## 🛠️ Notes

- Modify `docker-compose.yml` if you wish to link the APIs together or add more services.
- Ensure any environment variables or API secrets are managed using `.env` files (not included in this repo for security).
